It’s the outcome of years of austerity that saw people jobless, threatened and insecure.

Ideas of no work and no scarcity are therefore beyond comprehension for many.",

Western culture no longer embraces a religious approach to morality and ethics.",
    quote: "This past year has seen the continuation of high-profile attacks on religious liberty in the public arena as people of faith have been fired, refused employment, or fined for practicing their faith or speaking out about their religious beliefs,” it continued. The report noted that the number of attacks is likely much higher than what has been documented. What we collect is just what's published. So really it is just the tip of the iceberg because what's published is really a fraction of what is actually happening.",

    quote: "European countries have regarded themselves as more progressive than the home countries of their Middle Eastern immigrants, due in part to their secular orientation. They claim to be more progressive than Islamic countries on women’s rights and civil rights. Muslim minorities living in the West are expected to integrate into the mainstream Western culture and accept its “civilized” values. Yet in much of the West, religion has been replaced by individualism. Many Muslim immigrants contrasting these modern cultures with traditional values see them as decadent and hostile, creating among many a sense of the Western Other.",

    quote: "There is a salutary lesson here: in democratic societies at least, denialism cannot be beaten legally, or through debunking, or through attempts to discredit its proponents. That’s because, for denialists, the existence of denialism is itself a triumph. Central to denialism is an argument that “the truth” has been suppressed by its enemies.

    quote: "In other words, a cultural elite may be disliked for reasons that are not particularly economic: college professors, experts, NGO staffers and psychotherapists are not corporate titans, after all. It’s a new variation of an old-fashioned populism that is anti-intellectual and anti-expert.",

These tough-talking populists promise to protect “us” from “them.” Depending on who’s talking, “them” can mean the corrupt elite or the grasping poor; foreigners or members of racial, ethnic or religious minorities.
